# React Color Palette

This is a color palette app created with react.js by following Colt Steele's React course on Udemy.
The app includes features like viewing a collection of premade color palettes, copying colors from them, adjusting lightness or darkness of the colors, and viewing different shadows of a particular color.
User can also create his/her own custom color palette and save it.

I learned a lot about react, react routing, animations and a bunch of other things by developing this application.
